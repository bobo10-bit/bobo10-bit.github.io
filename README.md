# CS 499-ePortfolio
## Computer Science Capstone -Made by Christopher Wilson

### Introduction
Hello, my name is Christopher Wilson, and I have been in SNHU's computer science program for three years. During this time, I have built a solid foundation in communicating with stakeholders, software engineering, algorithms, databases, and secure coding. My coursework and ePortfolio show how I have grown as a developer and prepared to work in the field. I have gained hands-on experience designing applications, improving performance, managing data, and keeping systems secure.

In CS-255, I improved my skills in working with stakeholders by helping the DriverPass client. I reviewed their requirements, created use cases, and turned their needs into a working web-based system. I also strengthened my technical skills in data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. In CS-305, I worked with Artemis Financial to find vulnerabilities and make improvements that protected sensitive information, which taught me how important secure coding is in real-world systems.

My work in software engineering, like the CS-360 mobile inventory app, shows that I can build useful and practical applications. I added user profiles and input validation, which taught me how to handle data safely and make software that is both secure and easy for people to use. These changes helped me understand how to design programs that protect users and work well in real situations. I also learned how important it is to think about how users interact with an application and to plan features that make it simple and reliable.

In CS-320, I improved an application by replacing an ArrayList with a HashMap. This made searching for data much faster and helped me see how using the right data structures can make programs work better. I also learned how different algorithms can affect how fast and efficient a program runs. This taught me that making smart choices in coding can save time and make software more powerful and reliable.

In CS-340, I turned a Jupyter notebook dashboard into a web-based Dash app using mock data. This made the app easier to use for more people and showed that I can work with data in different ways. I learned how to filter, sort, and organize data for users and how to change a project so it can run in a new environment. This project also helped me practice thinking about how software works for different users and devices.

Overall, my ePortfolio shows my skills in software design, secure coding, algorithms, data management, and web development. The projects demonstrate not only what I have learned but also how I can use this knowledge to make programs better and more useful. These experiences helped me learn how to work on teams, solve problems, and create software that is safe, efficient, and reliable. My goal is to keep learning and improving as a developer, focusing on making software that is fast, secure, and easy for people to use.

### Code review
My code review are presentations of my projects that were used for my enhancment and explain what the various enhancement are.

### Enhancement One

My artifact is a mobile app created in CS-360 during the final project. This app has two screens for the user to interact with. The first screen allows the user to create an account and log in to it. Once the user logs in, it takes them to the second screen. The second screen is an inventory screen. It shows a blank table that shows items the user adds. The user can input an item name and quantity and once they do they can press a + button to add the item to the table. They can also delete the item by pressing the delete button next to the item in the table. They can also edit item names and quantities in the table. Finally, there is a notification system that the user can turn on that gives them a notification when a specific items stock is low.

I have chosen this artifact because it was one of my projects that took a lot of learning and time to create. This artifact was more complex and more advanced compared to my other projects, and so I wanted to showcase this artifact. This artifact shows my skills in mobile development and security. The whole app used a mobile app development program, which requires me to learn about mobile development. My login screen showcases the security measures I have taken to make sure that only users with proper login credentials can access the app. The artifact was improved by adding a profile system that only shows their specific table to that specific account. I have also fixed the issue where the user can add characters in the quantity field.

During the enhancement process, I learned the importance of commenting on my code. Before enhancing the project, I didn’t comment on the code fully which left me wondering what some code did. This took more time than expected which made me learn that I should add comments next time I create a project. One challenge I faced was with relearning some of the features. I have forgotten a little bit of the course and so I had to search for some code documentation to complete the enhancement process.
